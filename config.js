            description: 'Mole, a thick, rich sauce, often served with meats and rice is available in many form and varieties. Its history is rich and its name comes from the Nahuatl word for sauce – mōlli. Mole has early references in writings as a dish served to the Aztec Moctezuma. Long before the Spanish arrived to Mexico, indigenous women were grinding chile, tomatoes, corn, and other ingredients found in mole.',

            description: 'Mole also has non-indigenous ingredients such as cinnamon, clove, cumin, and sesame seeds. Mole may have deep roots in the Middle East. Large parts of Spain, almost the entire Iberian Peninsula was once a part of a Caliphate ruled by North African Muslims, the Moors. Traditions of this region were brought to Spain, including their dishes. Cookbooks of this region have sauces that are made with ground spices, nuts, and acid elements. While these sauces lack the chile and tomato (Mexican Indigenous ingredients) the sauce backbone is present. Ground nuts, seeds, spices, acidic elements, and liquid is central to Medieval Islamic cuisine and can be traced back to the golden age of Islam. Over time the Spanish began to adopt these ingredients to their own cuisines.',

            description: 'Mole has early references in writings as a dish served to the Aztec Moctezuma. The language of the Aztecs, Nahuatl, references molli as a sauce served with meats. Books mentioning this dish include Avila Blancas, San Pelayo, Gesta Independencia, and Mexicano Anonimo. These books mention several variations of mole and take place in 1690 – 1817. The ingredients in these books show non-indigenous materials introduced by the Spanish. Mole has changed and there is also history with its production in convents.  Convents in colonial Mexico were powerful because they owned land, had money, and resources. Nuns had the ability to have a career and own property. Nuns were able to get ingredients from their land, run a commercial kitchen with their indigenous slaves/servants, and oversaw the production of mole. On one side it was a business, however it was also the preparation for an elegant dish. The convents may have been the place to bring together the ingredients and traditions to create the staple dish. ',

            description: 'Around the time of independence, cuisine was a way for people to distinguish themselves from the Spanish. This process involved focusing on the mestizaje, a mixing of indigenous and Spanish roots. Mole became of a symbol of this mixing.  Mole is a labor of love, and it is time consuming to mix together all the ingredients, and create the sauce. The metate, a grindstone, where you move a stone across a lower stone was commonly used. It demands a women kneel and prepare this complex sauce. The hand ground sauce was still ubiquitous across Mexico because of the indigenous labor available. With the introduction of electricity, there was a move from the metate to the blender. This move has allowed for this to be commercialized, sold, and available to all cooks.',
